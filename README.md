Sure, here's an updated version of the `README.md` file with a more comprehensive description of the module, including all the new features:

# ai_sorting

The AI Sorting module provides an intelligent sorting mechanism for Drupal Views using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB2) algorithm. This module extends the Statistics module to incorporate AI-based sorting functionality, allowing for more dynamic and user-interaction-driven content presentation.

## Features

- **Integration with Drupal Views**: Seamlessly integrates with Drupal Views to provide AI-based sorting.
- **UCB2 Algorithm**: Utilizes the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB2) algorithm to intelligently sort nodes based on user interactions.
- **Configurable Exploration Parameter**: Allows configuration of the UCB2 algorithm's exploration parameter (`alpha`), controlling the balance between exploring new options and exploiting known successful options.
- **Custom Click Tracking**: Provides an option to use custom click tracking for more granular interaction data.
- **Statistics Module Integration**: Optionally integrates with the built-in Drupal Statistics module for tracking user interactions.
- **Node Visibility and Interaction Tracking**: Tracks node visibility and interaction counts to optimize sorting over time.
- **Increment Trials**: Automatically increments trial counts for nodes as they are displayed to users.
- **Click Tracking**: Tracks user clicks on nodes to gather interaction data and improve sorting accuracy.

## Requirements

- Drupal 10
- Views module
- Statistics module (optional, for default tracking method)

## Installation

1. Download and enable the `ai_sorting` module.
2. Ensure that the `views` and `statistics` modules are enabled.
3. Configure the AI Sorting settings in your Drupal Views.

## Configuration

1. **Add AI Sorting to a View**:
   - Go to the Views UI and edit the view where you want to add AI Sorting.
   - Add a new sort criterion and select `AI Sorting`.
   - Configure the `alpha` parameter to control the exploration-exploitation balance.
   - Choose the tracking method (`Statistics Module` or `Custom Click Tracking`).

2. **Custom Click Tracking**:
   - If you select `Custom Click Tracking`, ensure that the necessary JavaScript behaviors are attached to your view.
   - The module will automatically track clicks and send the data to the server for processing.

## Usage

- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Adjust the `alpha` parameter to control how the algorithm balances between exploring new content and exploiting known successful content. Higher values encourage more exploration, while lower values favor content that has performed well in the past.
- **Tracking Method**: Choose between using the built-in Drupal Statistics module or a custom click tracking implementation to gather interaction data.
